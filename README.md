# Weather Dashboard Web Application README (gh-pages branch)
**Under this branch, we have saved 8 function modules html documents generated by `pydoc`, including input args, output results, instructions and examples, please check them when using the modules and procedures of this project.**

**Follow these steps to clone the `gh-pages` branch of the repository to get the module description files generated by `pydoc` in it (Please take note that the cloned folder name of this branch is the same as the `main` branch `Weather_dashboard_project` )**
- Switch to a path where you want to clone the `pydoc` file (not the same path as cloning the main branch!!!)
- Open a command-line tool (such as Git Bash, Windows Command Prompt, or PowerShell).
- Use the following command to clone the repository of the main branch of the project:
  ```bash
  git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/kei-linyugui20223638023/Weather_dashboard_project.git
  ```
- Enter the cloned project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Weather_dashboard_project
    ```
**This way, you've cloned the `gh-page` branch and can check out the documentation for each module in it.**
